# Sabayon Reload Scripts

Build Sabayon from scratch with Ansible and Docker for:

  * check periodically if all sabayon-distro and for-gentoo overlay
    works correctly

  * simplify process for create a custom Sabayon Distro with
    different USE flags

  * simplify process for manage local repository

NOTE: It's under development. Not completed.

It is based on Sabayon Dockerfile written by mudler and Sabayon Team.

## The Story

TBD

## Process steps

For now only for amd64 platform.

### 1. stage3-gentoo-systemd-amd64

From Gentoo Stage3 tarball is created a docker image after update portage, rebuild @world and
remove some unneeded packages.

Ansible tag for this image is *amd64,amd64_gentoo_stage3*.

### 2. stage3-sabayon-amd64

From stage3-gentoo-systemd-amd64 is installed equo and entropy.

Ansible tag for this image is *amd64,amd64_sabayon_stage3*.

### 3. sabayon-base-amd64

From stage3-sabayon-amd64 is configure sabayon repository and sync with last packages version.

Ansible tag for this image is *amd64,amd64_sabayon_base*.

### 4. sabayon-spinbase-amd64

The purpose of this image is to provide an image of a Sabayon base with upgrades and tools,
ready to be shipped on VM(s)/LiveCDs.

Ansible tag for this image is *amd64,amd64_sabayon_spinbase*.

### 5. sabayon-builder-amd64

The purpose of this project is to provide an image of Sabayon docker-capable builder.
It is just a Sabayon base with upgrades and compilation tools.

For complete documentation see [Sabayon/docker-builder-amd64](https://github.com/Sabayon/docker-builder-amd64) page.

Ansible tag for this image is *amd64,amd64_sabayon_builder*.

## Images Tree

```

gentoo-stage3
     |
     |
     \--> sabayon-stage3 ------> sabayon-base  ----> sabayon-spinbase --> sabayon-builder
                          \
                           \
                            ---> sabayon-base-reload ---> sabayon-rebuilder
```

## Build Images

Under ansible directory, for build step 1:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64_gentoo_stage3 build.yml
```

For build step 2:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64_sabayon_stage3 build.yml
```

For build step 3:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64_sabayon_base build.yml
```

For build step 4:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64_sabayon_spinbase build.yml
```

For build step 5:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64_sabayon_builder build.yml
```

For build all AMD64 docker images:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook --tags amd64
```

For build all:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook build.yml
```

### ARM7 Stages

I begin integration of some Docker stage for ARMv7 (32bit) but is under development.

### Customize Build Process

Current ansible configuration permit build process on localhost but it is possible configure Ansible to build images to a remote machine.
See Ansible documentation for details.

In particular, under localhost host variable file it is possible customize these options:

| Option   |  Default | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| builder_rootdir  | ..  | Path of the sabayon-reload project tree.  |
| docker_user  | geaaru  | Name of the user used for create docker images  |
| gentoo_dist_server  | http://distfiles.gentoo.org/  | URL where retrieve portage tarball and gentoo stage3 file.  |
| gentoo_skip_sync | 1 | Execute portage sync before build process (1) or not (0). |
| sabayon_skip_sync | 1 | Execute equo update before install packages (1) or not (0). |
| staging_dir | ./staging | Directory used by sabayon-lxd-imagebuilder for convert docker image, etc. |
| lxd_target_server | local | Target LXD Server where upload images |
| lxd_skip_pull | 1 | Skip pull from docker image on create LXD images (1) or not (0). Normally, is set to 1 when images are created locally. |


## Test Suites

To permit a continuos delivery of the images and verify that all works fine there are different
playbooks to convert docker images of different tecnologies. Currently, it is supported LXD.

For test docker image on LXD images (or with same tags for test customized test):
Â²
```bash
  $# ansible-playbook lxd.yml -K
```

This playbook create also LXD images related to every steps on configured LXD server and require root permission (or sudo password with -K option).

### Create a fresh container from Docker Image

It is possible use playbook to simplify creation of a container with last image produced with this command:

```bash
  $# ansible-playbook lxd.yml -K --tags amd64_sabayon_spinbase --skip-tags skip_del_container -e container_name="my-container"
```

This create a new container with name "my-container" from sabayon_spinbase image.

For list of all tags:

```
  $# ansible-playbook lxd.yml --list-tags
```
